                <h3>Big B Restaurant</h3>
                <picture><img src="image/big_b.jpg" alt='big_g picture'></picture>
                <p>Big B’s is a small restaurant that first opened its main Branch at Rosignol, West Coast Berbice. The
                    business came about
                    just a few years after the closure of Baksh Cafe, which was located at the Rosignol stelling when
                    the Ferry Service was
                    operable.
                    Last week, the proprietors of Big B’s restaurant, Shabeer Baksh and his wife Maria, are elated as
                    they opened their
                    second branch at Pope and Main Streets, New Amsterdam, with the hope of serving the people of Region
                    6 with quality and
                    high standard service.
                    Shabeer said that his father operated a small business at the stelling some years ago, and that
                    motivated him to become
                    a business owner, and at the same time give back to the people.
                    He said as a little boy, growing up, he paid keen attention to his father’s work ethic, and how his
                    hard work made him a
                    successful entrepreneur. He said he was always in the shop, and found himself occupied with managing
                    their small
                    business while at the same time balancing education, which he noted was his main priority while
                    growing up.
                    “As a youngster growing up, what I did, unlike other youths going out and playing sports, I would
                    take that time and
                    assist him in the shop, because I knew how committed he was in establishing his business.
                    Unfortunately, when the
                    Berbice Bridge was built, the opportunity for sales at Rosignol Stelling went downhill for us. So,
                    we had to close that
                    down, and in 2015 me and my wife decided to go back on track, and that’s how we established Big B’s
                    restaurant. The name
                    Big B’s came from my father Baksh...<a

                <p>The Guyana Sugar Corporation (GuySuCo) is reporting that the Albion/Port Mourant Estate has surpassed
                    it weekly sugar
                    production target for the week ending March 20, 2021.

                    It related that this was the second time in four weeks that the Estate exceeded its weekly sugar
                    production target for
                    the first crop.

                    The Estate, which is tasked to produce 50.6 per cent of the Corporation’s first crop target of
                    42,608 metric tonnes,
                    churned out 2,021 metric tonnes surpassing its target of 1,999 metric tonnes.

                    That means that the Estate surpassed its target by 22 metric tonnes for the week.

                    Despite five hours of factory downtime, the Estate was able to ground for 142.5 hours.
                    The Estate recorded an average of 66 per cent harvesters’ attendance for the week; however, for the
                    last three days,
                    same had increased to over 80 per cent.

                    As at week ending March 20, the Estate produced 6,890 MT of sugar out of its First Crop’s target of
                    21,573 MT.

                    Meanwhile, the Corporation wishes to congratulate the Management, Staff and Workers of Albion/Port
                    Mourant Estate for
                    being the only Estate to achieve its weekly sugar production target for week ending March 20,
                    2021....<a href="https://www.inewsguyana.com/albion-estate-surpasses-weekly-production-target/">Read

                <p>THE Nand Persaud Group of Companies is calling on the Guyana Revenue Authority and law enforcement
                    authorities to
                    further strengthen their systems in the aftermath of illicit drugs being discovered on one of their
                    containers with
                    rice.

                    The Customs Anti-Narcotics Unit (CANU) has reported that it has found no conclusive evidence that
                    the suspected cocaine
                    found in a container of rice shipment intercepted by German police, earlier this month, was loaded
                    onto the container in
                    Guyana.

                    CANU stated that, following an extensive investigation into the handling, shipping and export of the
                    shipment of white
                    rice, it has unearthed loopholes and irregularities regarding the local handling of the
