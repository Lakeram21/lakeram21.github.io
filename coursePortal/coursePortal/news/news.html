                <h3>Guyana the only Caribbean country with GDP growth in 2020 – World Bank</h3>
                <p>Guyana, which started producing oil in 2019, was the sole Caribbean country with positive Gross
                    Domestic Product (GDP)
                    growth in 2020. This is according to a recent World Bank report that shed light on how Latin America
                    and the Caribbean
                    economies fared in 2020.

                    According to the World Bank report “2021. Renewing with Growth. LAC Semiannual Report”, Guyana was
                    able to do what 27
                    other countries in the region could not – record GDP growth, notwithstanding the global COVID-19
                    pandemic.<a

                <H3>Nand Persaud & Company: A landmark company in Guyana’s agricultural sector</H3>
                <p>To appreciate the national significance of the country’s most high profile rice milling company, Nand
                    Persaud & Company
                    Ltd. You have to cast your mind over the journey that the company has made from a one-tonne per hour
                    rice mill at No. 36
                    Village, Corentyne, to what it is today, an institution in local rice farming and a company that has
                    done well enough to
                    begin to look outside of itself, to the growth and development of the wider rice industry.

                    When the company’s serving Chief Executive Officer Mahindra Persaud agreed to talk to us a few weeks
                    ago, we travelled
                    to the No. 36 Village establishment. A queue of more than sixty trucks laden with paddy was waiting
                    to be processed and
                    paid. Some of them had overnighted. They didn’t mind. Nand Persaud & Company<a

                <h3>55 Employees from Albion Estate Central Workshop Benefit from Retroactive Payment</h3>

                <img src="image/guysuco.jpg" alt="guysuco">
                <p>Georgetown, October 2, 2020 – The Guyana Sugar Corporation Inc. (GuySuCo) signed an amended agreement
                    on Thursday
                    October 1, 2020, with the Guyana Agricultural and General Workers Union (GAWU), that will
                    specifically benefit the
                    Central Workshop employees at Albion Estate. The 2004 Comprehensive Collective Labour Agreement
                    (CLA) had considered
                    offering work to employees of the Central Workshop at the Albion Estate, on Saturdays, in lieu of
                    when a holiday falls
                    within the week at flat rate, since these workers are constant five days employees and would be off
                    for the holiday.
                    However, with the advent of the “National Minimum wage for regular working hours (for all workers in
                    Guyana) Order”, the
                    work week was fixed at 40 hours from five days, however, the Collective Labour Agreement between the
                    Corporation and
                    GAWU, stated that the employees work week is between Mondays through Fridays; therefore, Saturday’s
                    earnings was treated
                    as a premium day, if they worked all the days required through Mondays to Fridays.<a
